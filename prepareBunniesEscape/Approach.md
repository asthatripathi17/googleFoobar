# Problem Statement
You have maps of parts of the space station, each starting at a prison exit and ending at the door to an escape pod. The map is represented as a matrix of 0s and 1s, where 0s are passable space and 1s are impassable walls. The door out of the prison is at the top left (0,0) and the door into an escape pod is at the bottom right (w-1,h-1).

Write a function answer(map) that generates the length of the shortest path from the prison door to the escape pod, where you are allowed to remove one wall as part of your remodeling plans. The path length is the total number of nodes you pass through, counting both the entrance and exit nodes. The starting and ending positions are always passable (0). The map will always be solvable, though you may or may not need to remove a wall. The height and width of the map can be from 2 to 20. Moves can only be made in cardinal directions; no diagonal moves are allowed.

## Test Cases:
Input: (int) maze = [[0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0]]
</br>Output: (int) 7

Input: (int) maze = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
</br>Output: (int) 1

## Approach:

1. **Problem Understanding:** We are given a map representing a space station, where 0s represent passable space and 1s represent impassable walls. The task is to find the length of the shortest path from the prison door (top-left) to the escape pod door (bottom-right), with the option to remove one wall.

2. **Rat in a Maze Problem:** This problem can be approached as a variation of the classic "Rat in a Maze" problem, where the rat (or in this case, the explorer) needs to find a path from the starting point to the destination. However, in this variation, the explorer is allowed to remove one wall (k = 1).

3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** We can use BFS to explore all possible paths from the starting point to the destination. BFS ensures that we explore all possible paths level by level, starting from the entrance.

4. **Data Structures:** We use a queue (deque) to implement BFS. Each element in the queue represents a position in the maze along with the number of walls removed so far.

5. **Visited Nodes:** We maintain a data structure to keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting the same position with the same number of walls removed.

6. **Directions:** We define the directions in which the explorer can move (up, down, left, right), and we explore each direction from each position in the maze.

7. **Obstacle Removal:** When encountering a wall, if the explorer has the option to remove a wall (obstacle count > 0), we add a new position to the queue with the obstacle count reduced by one.

8. **Termination:** We continue BFS until we reach the destination or exhaust all possible paths. If the destination is reached, we return the length of the shortest path. If the destination is not reachable, we return -1.

9. **Solution Complexity:** The time complexity of BFS is O(m * n), where m and n are the dimensions of the maze. Since the maximum dimensions are 20x20, the solution is efficient.

This approach efficiently explores all possible paths from the starting point to the destination, considering the option to remove a wall if needed.
